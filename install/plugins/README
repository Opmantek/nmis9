NMIS plugins
------------

NMIS code plugins are meant to augment and extend the update and collect 
functionality, if and when classic modelling doesn't suffice to handle a 
particular scenario.

each plugin must be valid perl, be named X.pm, must have a 'package X;' line, 
and its package name must not clash with the other NMIS components. the 
plugin MUST NOT use Exporter to export anything from its namespace.

it's recommended that the plugin have a version declaration right after the 
package line, i.e. 'our $VERSION = "1.2.3";' 

the plugin may load extra perl modules with use or require, but it 
must not use any package-level global variables. all its variables and any
objects that it might create must have local scope.

a plugin can offer either or both of the functions update_plugin() and collect_plugin(). 

these functions will be called for each node in sequence,
independently (and possibly in separate processes), at the end of the
collect/update operation.  all existing valid plugins will be loaded, and
all available update_plugin()/collect_plugin() functions will be applied to
every node regardless of the plugins success or failure indications.

the calling interface is the same for both functions:

sub update_plugin(node => nodename, sys => live sys object, 
		config => read-only configuration object/hash)

sub collect_plugin(node => nodename, sys => live sys object, 
		config => configuration object/hash, treat as read-only)

the plugin can modify any node attributes via sys where required. it may call
other nmis code (but care needs to be taken of nmmis config/table caching if 
that is done). neither the local config object nor the global nmis config
must be modified by a plugin.

return values:

- (0 or undef,rest ignored) means no changes were made, or that the
plugin declined to run altogether (because this node has a
non-matching model for example)

- (1,rest ignored) means changes were made to the sys object, and nmis
will save the nodeinfo and view components.

- (2,list of error messages) means the plugin failed to work and NMIS
should please log the error messages. no nodeinfo/view saving will be 
performed.
