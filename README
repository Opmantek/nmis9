2. About NMIS
NMIS is an Open Source Network Management System which performs multiple

user demands. 

The distributed polling engine uses SNMP to collect availability 
and performance data for any SNMP capable device. A highly configurable and 
extensible GUI displays health and performance data focused on technical 
information, as well as high level reporting for executive reports.
