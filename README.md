## About NMIS
NMIS is an Open Source Network Management System which performs multiple
functions from the OSI Network Management Functional Areas. NMIS has evolved
rapidly to meet the demands of highly available production environments and
user demands.

NMIS has been developed continually since 1998 and remains open source.
Version 9 represents the most recent major generational upgrade.

The distributed polling engine uses SNMP to collect availability
and performance data for any SNMP capable device. A highly configurable and
extensible GUI displays health and performance data focused on technical
information, as well as high level reporting for executive reports.
